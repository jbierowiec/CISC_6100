# SWE Sudoku Project

This repository contains the source code for the Software Engineering Sudoku Project. The application is built using Flask for the frontend and Django for the backend, with the website designed to be dynamic and responsive, ensuring compatibility with both personal computers and mobile devices.

## Overview

The Sudoku Project is a web-based application that provides users with a customizable Sudoku experience. Users can select the difficulty, switch between light and dark mode, and track their game progress using an integrated timer.

## Features

### Timer Functionality
- **Automatic Reset**: The timer resets each time the user clicks on the "Create New Game" button.
- **Auto-Stop on Completion**: The timer stops when the user correctly solves the Sudoku puzzle.
- **Pause on Inactivity**: The timer pauses whenever the user switches to another browser tab or clicks the "Check Solution" button.

### Check Solution Button
- **Validation Against Stored Solutions**: Each Sudoku game is pre-generated and stored in a JSON file, including the solution. When the user clicks "Check Solution," the system verifies if the user’s inputs match the correct solution from the backend.
- **Issue to be Fixed**: Currently, for the "Check Solution" button to work correctly, the frontend must display the exact game generated by the backend. This means the user must manually select the correct difficulty level and click "Generate New Game" until the exact Sudoku puzzle appears. This will be improved so that the generated game directly syncs with the backend’s solution from the JSON file. For example if the backend generates a medium level game, on the frontend, you have to navigate to the difficulty dropdown, select, "Medium" and click the Generate New Game Button until you find the exact sudoku game that the backend provides. When you solve it and click the Check Solution button, a message will appear saying that the sudoku is solved. For all other cases, you will get an incorrect solution message. (This needs to be fixed, we should have the user click on generate new game, and that generated new game should prompt the backend to take the frontend game and match it from where the backedn is pulling the JSON file)

### Generate New Game Button
- **Difficulty-Based Game Selection**: The "Generate New Game" button fetches games from a `games.json` file, based on the selected difficulty. This file contains:
  - **Empty Cell Layouts**: Pre-made Sudoku games with varying levels of difficulty.
  - **Solutions**: Complete solutions for each Sudoku game.
  - **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, only in 4x4 grids. (9x9 grids with sudoku games, solutions, levels, and a toggle to choose this size should be implemented)

### Difficulty Dropdown
- **Difficulty Selection**: Users can select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) from a dropdown menu.
- **Dynamic Game Generation**: Based on the selected difficulty, the app generates a new game. For example:
  - If "Easy" is selected, only 4x4 easy games are displayed.
  - If "Medium" is selected, only 4x4 medium games are displayed.
  - If "Hard" is selected, only 4x4 hard games are displayed.

### Light and Dark Mode
- **Toggle Button**: A "Light/Dark Mode" button allows users to switch between light and dark themes, enhancing the user interface and user experience.

## Setup Instructions

To start the backend and frontend servers, follow these steps:

1. **Backend**:
   - Open a terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Start the Django backend server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

2. **Frontend**:
   - Open a second terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Start the Flask frontend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Alternative Setup**:
   - In the `past_github_upload` directory, you can run the program directly:
     ```bash
     cd past_github_upload
     python app.py
     ```

## Notes
- The games are stored in `games.json` and contain information on each game's grid layout, solutions, and difficulty level.
- Currently, selecting the correct puzzle on the frontend may require manually matching the backend puzzle. This neeeds to improved in future updates.
- We now need to try to a few (5 probably) 9x9 sudoku games (3 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard) (to test if the difficulty levels will work if we switch toggles between difficulty levels and size of grid). We also need to adjust the current functionality that works for 4x4 grids to now work for 9x9 grids, and make sure that when 9x9 grids are selected, a 9x9 grid is displayed, replacing the 4x4 grid and vice versa.
