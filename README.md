# SWE Sudoku Project

This repository contains the source code for the Software Engineering Sudoku Project. The application is built using Flask for the frontend and Django for the backend, with the website designed to be dynamic and responsive, ensuring compatibility with both personal computers and mobile devices.

---

## Overview

The Sudoku Project is a web-based application that provides users with a customizable Sudoku experience. Users can select the difficulty, switch between light and dark mode, and track their game progress using an integrated timer.

## Features

### Light and Dark Mode
- **Toggle Button**: A "Light/Dark Mode" button allows users to switch between light and dark themes, enhancing the user interface and user experience.

### Timer Functionality
- **Automatic Reset**: The timer resets each time the user clicks on the "Create New Game" button.
- **Auto-Stop on Completion**: The timer stops when the user correctly solves the Sudoku puzzle.
- **Pause on Inactivity**: The timer pauses whenever the user switches to another browser tab or clicks the "Check Solution" button.

### Generate New Game Button
- **Difficulty-Based Game Selection**: The "Generate New Game" button fetches games from a `games.json` file, based on the selected difficulty. This file contains:
  - **Empty Cell Layouts**: Pre-made Sudoku games with varying levels of difficulty.
  - **Solutions**: Complete solutions for each Sudoku game.
  - **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, only in 4x4 grids. (9x9 grids with sudoku games, solutions, levels, and a toggle to choose this size should be implemented)

### Check Solution Button
- **Validation Against Stored Solutions**: Each Sudoku game is pre-generated and stored in a JSON file, including the solution. When the user clicks "Check Solution," the system verifies if the user’s inputs match the correct solution from the backend.
- **Issue to be Fixed**: Currently, for the "Check Solution" button to work correctly, the frontend must display the exact game generated by the backend. This means the user must manually select the correct difficulty level and click "Generate New Game" until the exact Sudoku puzzle appears. This will be improved so that the generated game directly syncs with the backend’s solution from the JSON file. For example if the backend generates a medium level game, on the frontend, you have to navigate to the difficulty dropdown, select, "Medium" and click the Generate New Game Button until you find the exact sudoku game that the backend provides. When you solve it and click the Check Solution button, a message will appear saying that the sudoku is solved. For all other cases, you will get an incorrect solution message. (This needs to be fixed, we should have the user click on generate new game, and that generated new game should prompt the backend to take the frontend game and match it from where the backedn is pulling the JSON file)

### Undo Button
- The user can click on the Number Buttons or press on numbers on the PC keyboard and when the Undo Button is pressed, the most recent number will be popped from the user input history stack (array). (Last In First Out)

### Number Buttons
- If the user clicks on a Number Button without first clicking a empty cell, a message will show up on the screen, notifying the user that they should select an empty cell first
- If the user clicks an empty cell, and then clicks on any number, that number will be filled in the specific cell that the user previously clicked on

### Difficulty Dropdown
- **Difficulty Selection**: Users can select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) from a dropdown menu.
- **Dynamic Game Generation**: Based on the selected difficulty, the app generates a new game. For example:
  - If "Easy" is selected, only 4x4 easy games are displayed.
  - If "Medium" is selected, only 4x4 medium games are displayed.
  - If "Hard" is selected, only 4x4 hard games are displayed.

### Error Flags
- If the user enters any value in a cell where the row, column, or 2x2 square contains that same value, the cells where there are duplicates will turn red indicating an error in sudoku logic, meaning the user will have to input a different value in order to proceed in continuing the sudoku game.

## Setup Instructions

To start the backend and frontend servers, follow these steps:

1. **Backend**:
   - Open a terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Start the Django backend server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

2. **Frontend**:
   - Open a second terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Start the Flask frontend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Alternative Setup**:
   - In the `past_github_upload` directory, you can run the program directly:
     ```bash
     cd past_github_upload
     python app.py
     ```

## Notes
- The games are stored in `games.json` and contain information on each game's grid layout, solutions, and difficulty level.
- Currently, selecting the correct puzzle on the frontend may require manually matching the backend puzzle. This neeeds to fixed for proper frontend to backend communication.
- We now need to try to a few (7 probably) 9x9 sudoku games (3 easy, 2 medium, 2 hard) (to test if the difficulty levels will work if we switch toggles between difficulty levels and size of grid). We also need to adjust the current functionality that works for 4x4 grids to now work for 9x9 grids, and make sure that when 9x9 grids are selected, a 9x9 grid is displayed, replacing the 4x4 grid and vice versa.
- We need to implement buttons for: Undo Until Correct, Generate Random Hint, Generate Specific Hint, Set Note Mode Off/On, Show Solution
- Once evrything is fixed, implemented and the whole system is working, we can then add more functionality if needed, and we need to think about setting up a login system for individual users, other potential pages, like a settings page, etc.

## Description of Implementations
- Undo Until Correct Buton (take away all wrong numbers until it reaches the cells with only correct and preset values)
- Generate Random Hint Button (user clicks the button at anytime, and a empty cell is filled with a value from the solutions part of the JSON file)
- Generate Specific Hint Button (user clicks on an empty cell, then the user clicks on the Get Specific Hint Button and a value is filled in from the solutions part of the JSON file)
- Set Note Button (user clicks on this button, can fill a cell with 4 values for 4x4 sudoku or 9 values for 9x9 sudoku. Those values should all be within a single cell and should have a 2x2 layout for 4x4 sudoku or a 3x3 layout for 9x9 sudoku. If a user inputs a value in a cell that is in the same row or column of the noted cell, then the noted cell should pop the value that was noted, since the value is now used in a different cell. The values inside of the note cell should have those values in a cell in a small font)
- Show Solution Button (user does not want to solve the Sudoku game anymore and want to see the solution)
- Include 3 easy 9x9 sudoku games, 2 medium 9x9 sudoku games, 2 hard 9x9 sudoku games in the JSON file (can be changed later on to be a sqllite3.db)
- Dropdown button for the user to choose the sudoku game size, and for the corresponding grid to display and for the buttons to pull the properly sized games from the JSON file Sudoku game stored games
- Display of the 9x9 sudoku board game and vice versa 4x4 grid based on the user's choice of size from the Dropdown Button
- Make sure the functions become generalized to work for a 4x4 and a 9x9 grid
- Home page where the user first clicks on a size and difficulty and then they are redirected to the game (don't just have one game page with all th buttons and user choices there)
- Login system so that the user can log in to the game (be separated from individual users)
- Generate New Game button reloads the Backend to include that specifc game so that the Check Solution Button will work along with all other buttons
